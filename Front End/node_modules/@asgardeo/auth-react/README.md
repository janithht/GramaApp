## Introduction

Asgardeo Auth React SDK  allows React applications to use [OpenID Connect - OIDC](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) authentication with [Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/asgardeo) as the Consumer Identity and Access Management(CIAM) Provider. The SDK supports following capabilities
-   [Authenticate users](#add-a-loginlogout-button)
-   [Show Authenticated User's Information](#show-authenticated-users-information)
-   [Retrieve Additional User Information](/API.md#getbasicuserinfo)
-   [Secure Routes](/API.md#1-secureroute)
-   [Secure Components](/API.md#3-authenticatedcomponent)
-   [Send HTTP Requests to Asgardeo](/API.md#httprequest)

## Prerequisite - Register your application in Asgardeo

1. Register to [Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/asgardeo) and create an organization if you don't already have one. The organization name you choose will be referred to as `<org_name>` throughout this document.
2. [Register a Single Page Application in Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/docs/guides/applications/register-single-page-app/#register-the-app) to obtain necessory keys to integrate your application with Asgardeo. You will obtain a `client_ID` from Asgardeo for your application which will need to embed later in your application for the integration. 


## Getting Started

Follow this guide to integrate Asgardeo to your own React Application. To try out the sample apps, use [this guide](/SAMPLE_APPS.md).

### 1. Installing the Package

Run the following command to install `@asgardeo/auth-react` & `react-router-dom` from the npm registry.

Use below command if you are using *React v16.8* or greater & *React Router v6*

```bash
npm install @asgardeo/auth-react react-router-dom --save
```
Else if you are using *React v16.8* or greater & *React Router v5*, use below command

```bash
npm install @asgardeo/auth-react@1.1.19 react-router-dom@5.3.4 --save
```

> **Note**
> The `react-router-dom` package is a peer-dependency of the SDK and it is required to be installed for the SDK to work. We are working on making it optional.

### 2. Import [`AuthProvider`](/API.md#authprovider) and Provide [Configuration Parameters](/API.md#authreactconfig)

Asgardeo React SDK exposes the `AuthProvider` component, which helps you easily integrate Asgardeo to your application.

First, import the `AuthProvider` component from `@asgardeo/auth-react.` where you applications root component is defined.
> **Note**
> Typically the root component of a react app is defined in the index.* file.

```TypeScript
import { AuthProvider } from "@asgardeo/auth-react";
```
Then, wrap your root component with the `AuthProvider`.


```TypeScript
import React from "react";
import { AuthProvider } from "@asgardeo/auth-react";

const config = {
     signInRedirectURL: "https://localhost:3000/sign-in",
     signOutRedirectURL: "https://localhost:3000/dashboard",
     clientID: "<client_ID>",
     baseUrl: "https://api.asgardeo.io/t/<org_name>",
     scope: [ "openid","profile" ]
};

export const MyApp = (): ReactElement => {
    return (
        <AuthProvider config={ config }>
            <App />
        </AuthProvider>
    )
}
```
> **Note**
> You can refer to the [details of `AuthProvider` `config` here](/API.md#authreactconfig)

Once the root component is wrapped with AuthProvider, [`useAuthContext()` hook](#useauthcontext-hook) can be used anywhere within the application to implement user authentication capabilities in the application.


## Using APIs

### Best practices when using APIs

Asgardeo Auth React SDK is built on top of [Asgardeo Auth SPA SDK](https://github.com/asgardeo/asgardeo-auth-spa-sdk), a base library. Hence, almost all the usable APIs from Auth SPA SDK are re-exported from Asgardeo Auth React SDK and you don't need to import dependencies from the base library to your application.

- The only SDK that should be listed in the app dependencies is `@asgardeo/auth-react`.
- Always import APIs from `@asgardeo/auth-react`.

>**Warning**
>IDE or Editor auto import may sometimes import certain APIs from `@asgardeo/auth-spa`, change them back manually.

<details><summary><strong>Click here for Tips:</strong> Do's When importing a component from Asgardeo React SDK</summary>
<p>
    
##### DO ✅
```TypeScript
import { AsgardeoSPAClient } from "@asgardeo/auth-react";
```

#### When including React SDK as a dependency:

##### DO ✅
```json
// In package.json

dependencies: {
    "@asgardeo/auth-react": "^2.0.0"
}
```
</p>

### `useAuthContext()` hook

The `useAuthContext()` hook provided by the SDK could be used to implement the necessary authentication functionalities and access the session state that contains information such as a unique identifier for the authenticated user.

Import the `useAuthContext()` hook from `@asgardeo/auth-react`.
```Typescript
import { useAuthContext } from "@asgardeo/auth-react";
```

And then inside your components, you can access the context as follows
```Typescript
const { state, signIn, signOut } = useAuthContext();
```

Few common methods that you will require when implementing authentication capabilities in your application.
-   [`signIn`](API.md#signin) - Initiate a login request to Asgardeo, process the response to obtain authentication response.  
-   [`signOut`](API.md#signout) - Logout the user from Asgardeo and clear any authentication data from the SDK storage.
-   [`isAuthenticated`](API.md#isauthenticated) - Check whether there is an authenticated user session. Based on the result you can decide to change the application view/behaviour.
-   [`getBasicUserInfo`](API.md#getbasicuserinfo) - Get authenticated user's basic information from the authentication response.
-   [`getDecodedIDToken`](API.md#getdecodedidtoken) - Get the decoded `id_token` obtained in the authentication response. From there you can derive more information such as additional user-attributes.
-   [`getIDToken`](API.md#getidtoken) - Get the `id_token` (JWT) obtained in the authentication response. 
-   [`getAccessToken`](API.md#getaccesstoken) - Get the `access_token` obtained in the authentication response. 
-   [`refreshAccessToken`](API.md#refreshaccesstoken) - Get the `refresh_token` obtained in the authentication response. 
-   [`getHttpClient`](API.md#gethttpclient) - Get an HttpClient instance so that the you can make RESTful calls to the backend, where the client will attach the necessary Authorization headers to the request. 

The [`state`](API.md##authstateinterface) object will contain attributes such as whether a user is currently logged in, the username of the currently logged-in user etc. 

>**Note**
>You can refer to the [detailed API documentation here](/API.md)

### Add a Login/Logout Button

You can use the `signIn()` method from `useAuthContext()` to easily implement a **login button**.
```Typescript
<button onClick={ () => signIn() }>Login</button>
```

Similarly to the above step, we can use the `signOut()` method from `useAuthContext()` to implement a **logout button**.
```Typescript
<button onClick={() => signOut()}>Logout</button>
```
Clicking on **Login button** will take the user to Asgardeo login page. Upon successful `signIn()`, the user will be redirected to the app (based on the specified `signInRedirectURL`) and the `state.isAuthenticated` will be set to `true`.

Clicking on **Logout button** will sign out the user and will be redirected to `signOutRedirectURL` and the `state.isAuthenticated` will be set to `false`. 

> **Note**
> Instead of buttons you can use the `signIn()` & `signOut()` methods from the SDK to implement any preffered user-experience in your application

You can use the `state.isAuthenticated` attribute to check the authenticated status of the user.

---
###  Show Authenticated User's Information

The following code snippet demonstrates the usage of the `state` object, together with `signIn()` and `signOut()` methods from the context.
```Typescript
import React from "react";
import { useAuthContext } from "@asgardeo/auth-react";

function App() {

  const { state, signIn, signOut } = useAuthContext();

  return (
    <div className="App">
      {
        state.isAuthenticated
          ? (
            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>{state.username}</li>
              </ul>

              <button onClick={() => signOut()}>Logout</button>
            </div>
          )
          : <button onClick={() => signIn()}>Login</button>
      }
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
